# Generators of I(Sec(C_6))

This repository contains the code computing the generators of an ideal of secant variety of a normal elliptic curve of degree 6 embedded in CP^5. The code is written in [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de). 

For details, see [Geometry of elliptic normal curves of degree 6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11672).
